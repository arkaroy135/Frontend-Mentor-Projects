## My process

I learnt to use grid layout effectively in this project. It was harder at first but it was fun.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
img {
  transform: translate(14.5rem, 1.5rem);
}

#card1,
#card4 {
  grid-row: span 2;
}
```

I learned that by using this I can move elements without positioning it as absolute. And also learnt how to use grid-row/grid-column span.

### Continued development

I need to learn about proper use of HTML tags and CSS properties. There is a lot to learn on the way.

        I
        received a
        job
        offer
        mid-course, and
        the
        subjects
        I
        learned were
        current, if not
        more
        so,
        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>
      <p class="text-body font-medium leading-5 font-Barlow opacity-70 px-2 pt-2">“ I was an EMT for many years
        before I
        joined
        the bootcamp.
        I’ve been
        looking to
        make a
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
        100% recommend! ”</p>
